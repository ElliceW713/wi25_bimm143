## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: https://rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB \> Analyze \> PDB Statistics \> By Exp method and molecular type.

```{r}
# load in database
pdb_stats <- read.csv("pdb_data_dist.csv")
pdb_stats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

82.83549% of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray while 10.75017% are solved by Electron microscopy.

```{r}
pdb_stats$X.ray
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric.

```{r}
x <- pdb_stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",", "", x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the 'read_csv()' function.

```{r}
library(readr)
pdb_stats <- read_csv("pdb_data_dist.csv")
pdb_stats
```

```{r}
colnames(pdb_stats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdb_stats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures

```{r}
x_ray_tot <- sum(df$x_ray)
em_tot <- sum(df$em)
```

Total number of structures

```{r}
tot_structure <- sum(df$total)
```

Proportion of X-ray structures and electron microscopy

```{r}
x_ray_tot/tot_structure * 100
em_tot/tot_structure * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

86.23852% of structures in the PDB are protein.

```{r}
df[df$molecular_type == "Protein (only)",]$total/(tot_structure) * 100
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 4,683 structures in the current PDB. 

## 2. Using Mol\*

The main Mol\* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/ We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We only see 1 atom per water molecule in this structure because it is only showing the oxygen molecule of the water. 

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

This water molecule has residue number 308. 

![Water 308](1HSG(1).png)

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 protein chains: Chain A & B

Looking at the 'pdb' object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with 'install.packages("r3dmol")'

```{r}
library(r3dmol)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
# view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "white")
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the 'nma()' function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules. 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)

plot(m)
```
Write out a trajectory of predicted molecule motion: 
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Load file into Mol*

### Setup

> Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

msa is not found on CRAN

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?

bio3d-view is not found on either BioConductor or CRAN

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

TRUE

### Search and retrieve ADK structures

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

> Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

There are 214 amino acids in this sequence.
